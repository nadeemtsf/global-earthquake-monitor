A high-performance, real-time **data science dashboard** built with **Streamlit** that monitors global earthquake activity by aggregating and normalizing data from multiple sources: **USGS Earthquake Catalog** and **GDACS (Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System)**.

The application uses a **strategy-based provider architecture** to fetch data in parallel, ensures long-term persistence with a **local cache**, and presents interactive, theme-consistent visualizations powered by **Plotly**.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended: Docker)

Testing and deploying the application is easiest using **Docker**:

1. **Clone and Build**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nadeemtsf/global-earthquake-monitor.git
   cd global-earthquake-monitor
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Access the Dashboard** at `http://localhost:8501`

### Or Run Locally with Python

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/app.py
   ```

## 📊 Key Features

### 📡 Multi-Provider Data Pipeline
- **Parallel Fetching** — Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` to fetch data from **USGS** and **GDACS** simultaneously, significantly reducing load times.
- **Provider Architecture** — Modular design (Strategy Pattern) for data providers, making it easy to add new seismic sources.
- **Historical data access** — Select any date range (days, months, or years back).
- **Network Resilience** — Automatic fallback to a persistent **local `.cache/` directory** if upstream APIs are unreachable.

### 📥 XML Export for XSLT
- Raw **QuakeML XML** and GDACS XML files are exported on every fetch.
- **Download XML** buttons in the sidebar for one-click export, ideal for downstream XSLT transformation pipelines.

### 🧩 Data Science & Processing
- **Schema Normalization** — Consistent data schema across differing providers (GeoJSON vs RSS/XML).
- **Alert Classification** — Standardized alert level logic (🔴 ≥7.0, 🟠 ≥5.5, 🟡 ≥4.5).
- **Region Extraction** — Automated parsing of country and region tags from unstructured location strings.
- **Tsunami Flags** — Integrated warnings and specialized map styling for tsunami-prone events.

### 📈 Interactive Dashboard
- **Plotly Visualizations** — 100% interactive charts (Bar, Pie, Boxplot, Scatter, Line) with custom hover tooltips and consistent dark-theme styling.
- **Dynamic Map (Pydeck)** — High-performance scatterplot map with radius scaling and alert-level color coding.
- **Real-time Filters** — Instantly filter by date, magnitude, region, and alert level.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

### Performance & Scalability
- **Multithreading**: Parallelizing API requests for a more responsive user experience.
- **Dockerization**: Consistent development environment using `python:3.11-slim`.
- **Streamlit Caching**: Optimized `@st.cache_data` decorators to minimize redundant processing.

### Quality Assurance
- **Linting**: Enforced code quality with `ruff`.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive `pytest` suite for core utilities and data parsers.
- **Persistence**: Decoupled cache from system temp to ensure network resilience across reboots.
